#An API to give me messages from those I trust.

## Things I should do
1. The sender of the message should also have guarantees around if the message is being sent
to the intended recipient. Three: 
  1. HTTPS + Certificate 
  2. The server should responded by signing the message with the recievers private key. This
      would alert the user to compare after the fact which is better than nothing.

## What would be nice
1. The store stage should not be associated with a single action, e.g: saving to disk. But,
may involve multiple events with a programmable configuration. i.e if sender is one of X send SMS. For all, send e-mail.
The server should be a middleware confirming the identity of users.
2. File support.
3. Unikernel per GPG instance

##Beware
1. Communications to the API should be protected
under https, to prevent replay attack. On the program level,
reply is (will be?) prevented by a store of signatures over time,
meaning the same message can not be sent twice
if it is signed with the same key.
